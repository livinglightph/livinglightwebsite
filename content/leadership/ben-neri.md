### 

Rev. Benjamin A. Neri is married for 33 years now and a father of one, and has been in the ministry since 1971, the host of God’s Miracle Hour Radio and TV.

Broadcast aired over RPN TV – Channel 9 and Radio GMA DYSS. Saved at age 16, Pastor Ben (as bretheren call him) answered the call to the ministry and went through four years of bible training to equip himself for the task he is called to do.

It was in the early years of his ministry that he heard from the Lord that he is called beyond the boarders of his church. And few years, later he began to travel to the nations in revival and evangelistic crusade in accordance to the mandate that he received while preaching in his church one day, that he is going to walk the nations for Jesus.

While in the US in 1986, the Lord spoke to him to return to Cebu City, the hub of communication and transportation in the Philippines ; to take the Air-waves for Jesus.

He believes that each believer is the carrier of the life of God which is the answer to every need and circumstance; and living in God’s presence which brings us to that place of empowerment.
