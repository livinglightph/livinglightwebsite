Ptra. Zenaida Y. Neri or Ate Zeny as the brethren call her, is the partner of Ptr. Ben not only as a wife and mother of their daughter Jessah Mae, but also in the work of the Lord.

Being with her husband through pioneering two churches in other parts of the Philippines, she has faithfully labored in the vision God has laid on his shoulder in taking the Gospel to people’s homes through Radio and TV since 1985 in Dumaguete City during the times of “God’s Miracle Hour” Ministry’s days of small beginnings.

Being his only partner, she operated the TV camera while Ptr. Ben was interviewing or preaching on the set as well as his lone prayer partner since God’s Miracle Hour was first aired in Cebu City in the mandate of the Lord to “take the airwaves for Jesus”.

Having witnessed the formation of this ministry and co-pastored with her husband towards its success, she has discovered that prayer and the presence of God in worship is the key to revival and success in the ministry.

She has expanded her work to leadership as director over Daystar Children’s Mission, the ministry’s outreach to the street children of downtown Cebu.
